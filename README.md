ðŸš§ Note: WIP ðŸš§

Following [our recent report on tokenization](https://info.binance.com/en/research/marketresearch/tokenization.html), we (the Binance Research team) decided to start developing a **standard framework to evaluate blockchain-based tokens**. <br>

Specifically, this framework attempts to evaluate these tokens based on both **the underlying source code and their technological implementation.** <br>

Any contributor can contribute to this framework by submitting pull requests. <br>

All your contributions will be reviewed and incorporated (if relevant).

Please find the existing draft at the link below.
